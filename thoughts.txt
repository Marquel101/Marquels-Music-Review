WHAT I WANT WEBSITE TO DO:



CREATE A DROP DOWN FOR 5(+) ARTIST
  -LOT OF CSS
WHEN CLICKED THEIR NAME AND RANDOM LYRIC SHOULD SHOW
  -NEED A RANDOMIZER FOR LYRICS OF RESPECTIVE ARTIST
  -TEXT BOX OF MY PREFERENCES SHOULD SHOW
SHOULD BE ABLE TO SORT THROUGH RANDOM LYRICS OF CHOICE FOR EVERY ARTIST
BE ABLE TO RETURN TO HOMEPAGE FROM ANY POINT OF PAGE

1. FETCH LINKS FOR EACH SONG MAKE SURE THEY WORK
2. MAKE TABS FOR EVERY ARTIST
3. GROUP SONGS BY ARTIST
-EACH ARTIST WILL HAVE THEIR OWN FUNCTION
4. HAVE BACKGROUND CHANGE FOR RESPECTIVE ARTIST
5. DISPLAY TEXT FOR LYRICS AND MY CHATTER
6. MAKE A BUTTON TO CYCLE THROUGH LYRICS
